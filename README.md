# Retaliation Security Prevention

Inside of this software you may find a multitude of "backdoors". These are not meant for malicious intents to base users or servers. What you see is not meant for those that abide by Discord ToS. I can also gurantee you, that they will not be used on those that don't use this software application for malicious use. What you're finding is services used to stop what is called "leakers". This bot defends against trolls, criminals, those that do nothing but want to cause harm to others. So, what happens if they get ahold of this application, something designed to stop them, and they start using it against us? Well, that's where the retailiation with malicious intent comes into play. Through a multitude of security checks and such, I am able to stop trolls and malicious users dead int their tracks if they so choose to use my software maliciously. Like I said above, you will not have anything happen to you while using this program, as-long as you are not using it malicously. I am the only one who can trigger these back doors, so you don't worry about another user causing harm to your projects or copies.
